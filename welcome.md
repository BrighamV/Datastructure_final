## Stacks, Linked Lists, and Trees 

 This is a Data Structures Tutorial using Python. You will learn to create and work with these three data structures over this tutorial. You will find examples and problems to help you along the way. 

 Data structures are the tool we use to store data. Because data is all around us we need a method to store it in a way that it can be retrieved. We are learning about three data structures. The Stack, Linked List and Tree all have their own benefits. One of the most important thing to remember about data structures is that they take computing power to store and retrieve data. Because of this we need to understand that some data structures are more efficent than others. 

## Efficiency


 We calculate this efficiency using a term called big O notation. Big O notation is a simple way of telling us if a data structure is going to be efficient. 

 Common Big O notation values are O(1), O(n), and O(log<sub>n</sub>). We hope to never see O(n<sup>2</sup>).

O(1) Means we simply know where to put the data or where to take the data out. 

O(n) Means we need to look through all of our data to find the information we need. Because our data can be any size we use an n to reperesent how large our data is. This means O(n) can get very "expensive" depending on how large our data set is. 

O(log<sub>n</sub>) can be a little bit confusing. O(log<sub>n</sub>) means we are taking our results and breaking it down into smaller pieces, by doing so we dont need to look through our whole data set (In this case our data NEEDS to be sorted). 

O(n<sup>2</sup>) would mean we are searching through the data and looking through each piece of data's data. In other words we have a nested loop to find or manipulate our data. 

## Getting started


We're going to get started with the stack!

Go ahead and start with the [stack](stack.md).

Then you can move onto the [linked list](linked-list.md).

Finaly you can learn about the [tree](tree.md).
